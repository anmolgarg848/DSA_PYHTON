    /*TIME COMPLEXITY

     Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.
     It gives an upper bound on the time required for an algorithm,
     helping to evaluate its efficiency and scalability.

     Big-O notation: Big-O notation is used to describe the upper bound or worst-case time complexity.
     It ignores constant factors and lower-order terms.

     Calculation -->
     1. Always consider your code for WORST CASE SCENARIO
     2. Avoid constants & lower values
     [1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + . .. . . .N ]   number of iterations ==>  (n * (n + 1))/2;


    SPACE COMPLEXITY-->

    AUXILARY SPACE  (space that the algo takes to solve the problem)
                             +
     INPUT SPACE (space that is used to store the Input/output)

    int a = 0 , b = 1;
    int c = a+b;   //c is the auxillary space takes by algorithm to calculate

   NOTE :-  NEVER DO ANYTHING TO INPUT DATA

   FOR SERVERS / if they state time limit 1 sec

   1 SEC = 10^8 operations
   2 SEC = 2 * (10^8) operations
